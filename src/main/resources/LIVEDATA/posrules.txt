# HAS = any bit matching (could be only bit it has)
# IS = bits from this collection match and no other bits are left over
# INCLUDE = has one or more of these bits AND has other bits -- DO NOT ! this, must be the ONLY field which also has * on it
# -- beware of using !IS (should use HAS) because it will match while still ambiguous
# BIG can be used to double the size of a rule
# Note a pattern should have only one "include", the bits you are deciding to keep or discard. Other places should use IS or HAS.
# Using !IS is probably w4rong, since unresolved nodes will match. Use !HAS instead

# ISCLAUSE = has a freestanding noun and verb after it (can never use ! )
# HASPROPERTY = check for presence of OTHER_SINGULAR, OTHER_PLURAL. absence means nothing but presence is important so dont use ! (defined for determiner and pronoun)
# START = this is just before 1st word of sentence
# ISROLE - only valid for regular test, not negative
# ENDSWITH - matches the characters given
# 0 = no bits
