SUMO, the suggested upper merged ontology, is an open source ontology that maps nouns and verbs in Wordnet in a formal
way. 

Here is another ontology that maps nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.


*hierarchy.txt are the abstract hierarchy files.
*.txt are the filled in trees with the words covered.

A beginning abstract hierarchy for verbs looks like this:

0.~verbs (3379) 
1.    ~animate_verbs (3180) 
2.        ~affect_object_verbs (686 / 37) 
3.            ~alter_age (2) 


where the nest level is shown (0) the concept (~verbs) and the count of how many words are subsumed (3379).
Sometimes there are two counts (686/37) which means the total words subsumed and how many words are not
sorted into subcategories yet (incomplete).

a + in front of a word indicates it is located multiply in the tree.
